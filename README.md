# Data-Cleaning
Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset to ensure data quality and reliability for analysis or other data-driven tasks.
Duplicate numbers, misspelled words, incorrect labeling, data-type extraction mistakes, or inaccurate data can all result in unclean data. One of the most important skills to have as a data professional is data cleaning, which is performed by most professionals most of the time.
Every data type has a different format, and improper data type labeling can lead to inaccurate information on graphs and visualizations, poor forecasts, misleading information, and misrepresentation.

The process of cleaning data includes importing datasets, merging datasets, finding missing values, adding or filling in missing values, renaming or deleting unnecessary columns, eliminating duplicates, purging contaminated data, repairing leaky pipelines, resolving string and date time issues, eliminating duplicates or analyzing them separately, standardizing and normalizing, confirming data adequacy, and performing additional procedures based on the specific data science problem at hand.

Examples of Datatypes

1. Text data: Product name, address, last name, and first name
2. Categories: Gender and marital status
3. Decimals: Exchange rate, temperature
4. Integers: Products sold, subscribers
5. Dates: Date of order, date of shipment, date of birth
6. Binary: true or false, yes or no. 

Making sure variables have the appropriate data type is crucial. Data type restrictions, numerical/text or categorical features, data range constraints, unique constraints, inconsistent capitalization, membership limitations, trailing space, and phone number columns are among the common problems in datasets that need to be cleaned up.
